# Project_PRG_282

You need to create an initial menu for the Data Capturer who will use
this application. The Data Capturer should be presented with a Login
Form which will require their Username and Password. All Usernames
and Passwords must be stored on a text file [in any format of your
choosing]. The login should be verified and authenticated when a Data
Capturer attempts to login. If a Data Capturer does not have a
Username and Password, they should be able to register as a new user
and their login details stored on the text file. Make sure all necessary
validations are done for the Login Form.
2) Once the Data Capturer logs on the application, they should be
presented with a Windows GUI to perform all CRUD operations. Utilize
ADO.Net to achieve this. All information MUST be stored on a database
using SQL Server.
3) When capturing student information, on Create, the application should
capture the following student information to the database:
▪ Student Number
▪ Student Name and Surname
▪ Student Image
▪ DOB
▪ Gender
▪ Phone
▪ Address
▪ Module Codes
4) On Read, make sure student information can be displayed in a ListView
or DataGridView. Update, it must be possible to change student’s
information. On Delete, it must be possible to delete a student’s
information. The application must also have a Search functionality to
search a particular student’s information using the Student’s ID.
5) When capturing module information, on Create, the application should
capture the following module information to the database:
▪ Module Code
▪ Module Name
▪ Module Description
▪ Links to particular online resources (use YouTube videos that
relate to each module)
6) The rest of the other CRUD operations must apply for displaying,
updating, deleting and searching for a module to and from the
database
